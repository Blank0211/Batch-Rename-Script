# Batch-Rename-Script
A batch renaming script written in python  
i'm stil in the process of improving it.

If you're using 'batch rename 2.py', you'll have to place it in the directory where files (which you want to rename) are located  

Tip: Hold ALT, then press F to open Powershell in your current directory
